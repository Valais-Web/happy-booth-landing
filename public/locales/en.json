    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How much space is needed and can it be installed outside?",
        "answer": "About 3×3 meters and an electrical outlet are needed. Outdoor installation is possible if the space is sheltered."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is printing really unlimited?",
        "answer": "YES! Unlike our competitors who limit to 150-400 prints, at Happy Booth it's REALLY unlimited. Your guests can print as much as they want. The more photos, the more fun!"
      },
      {
        "question": "How do we get the digital photos?", 
        "answer": "All photos are immediately available in a private online gallery accessible to all your guests. You will also receive all high-definition files after the event."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if internet is weak or the photobooth breaks down?",
        "answer": "Weak internet: No problem! Printing works offline, email sending will happen as soon as the network is available.\n\nBreakdown (very rare): We always have backup equipment ready and a technician available 24/7. In case of breakdown, we replace the equipment within the hour or fully refund the service. No event has ever been ruined by a breakdown with us."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my elderly guests or children know how to use it?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! The interface is ultra-intuitive with clear icons and can be configured in 6 languages. Children from 5 years old use it without problem, and we can provide a stool for the smallest ones. Host option available to accompany your guests (45 CHF/hour)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why not simply put an iPhone with a printer?",
        "answer": "A professional photobooth offers: studio quality (lighting, pro lens), interactive animations impossible on smartphone, high-quality instant prints, automatic queue management, complete customization, and above all real animation that creates the event. DIY requires someone dedicated all evening."
      },
      {
        "question": "800-1000 CHF for a few hours, isn't that excessive?",
        "answer": "Divided by 100 guests = 8-10 CHF per person for a personalized souvenir they will keep. Let's compare: a photographer costs 2000-4000 CHF, a DJ 1500 CHF. Our professional equipment costs over 15,000 CHF and requires maintenance, transport, customization (2h graphic preparation), installation (2h), and technical presence."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if few people use it in the end?", 
        "answer": "Never happened in 1000+ events! Average statistics: 80% of guests use it, 3-5 passes per person, 300-600 photos per event of 100 people. Strategic placement (near bar/dance floor) and our fun accessories guarantee success. \"Satisfied or refunded\" guarantee if less than 50 photos taken."
      },
      {
        "question": "When to book?",
        "answer": "Ideally 2-4 months in advance for major dates, but we also accept last-minute bookings depending on availability."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why pay more than a low-cost provider's offer?",
        "answer": "Budget offers often require you to manage yourself: equipment pickup (round trip by car), installation (1-2h assembly with manual), technical problem resolution, and return by carrier. They also generally limit prints (200-400 maximum) - imagine having to refuse prints to your guests at the end of the evening!\nOur premium service includes: complete installation/uninstallation by us, REALLY unlimited prints (often 500+ photos per event), immediate technical support in case of trouble, exclusive technologies (Mirror with AI, 360° platform), and professional graphic customization.\nThe 200-300 CHF extra cost generally represents less than 3 CHF per guest to eliminate all stress and guarantee a perfect experience. It's the assurance that at the slightest problem, it's our responsibility, not yours. On your event day, you have better things to do than play technician!"
